      "An almond, despite being classified as a nut by most, is actually the seed from the fruit of an almond tree.  Fats & Proteins: A single cup of almonds has approximately 30 grams of protein and 71 grams of fat. Almonds contain a high level of fat. However, more than 50% of those fats good fats, which are good for heart and are essential for organ function. However, they also contain bad fats, so it is important not to overdo it. A handful at a time is a great choice, and will give you a nice boost!  Minerals: it is a rich source of fibre, protein, and a number of essential vitamins and minerals, such as B-vitamins, potassium, magnesium, and zinc.   Calories: Roughly 23 almonds would give 130 calories.  Carbs: There are only 5 grams of carbohydrates in a cup of almonds, which represents only 2% of your suggested daily requirement for carbs.  Almonds come packed with plant sterols, which are compounds that prevent your body from absorbing cholesterol. One-third cup of almonds a day, especially when you swap them for a less healthy snack choice, lowers your levels of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.  Almonds contain Fibre. The fiber contributes to consistent bowel movements, and the general health of the body through the elimination of toxins. Of all the nuts, almonds have the most calcium, at about 75 milligrams per ounce. Calcium is key for bone building, blood clotting, healthy muscles, and a strong heart.  Noshing on almonds helps you feel fuller, which can curb your cravings. In fact, some studies show almonds can help boost your metabolism  The unsaturated fat in almonds boosts your serotonin levels during the day. Serotonin is a chemical in your brain that helps control your sleep/wake cycles. Higher levels during the day mean better sleep at night. Almonds are great sources of alkali materials, and it is thought to strengthens the immune system. They also contain Vitamin E which seeks out damaging free radicals (which promote disease) in the body and eliminate them.  Almonds can help feed healthy gut bacteria like bifidobacteria and lactobacillus.  These bacteria help you digest fiber, prevent infections, and put out important healthy chemicals. According to research, almonds also help to reduce the reactionary rise in glucose and insulin levels after meals. This modulation offers protection from the dangerous spikes in blood sugar, which diabetics often suffer from following a large meal, or a meal with an unexpectedly high level of sugar in it. [6] They help regulate the absorption and processing of glucose, making the entire process much smoother, and subsequently safer. Almonds have plant proteins which are important in the BP effect. Almonds also contain elements which are neglected in usual food consumption, thereby affecting the entire body. This results in anxiety, stress and increased blood pressure  Regular consumption of almonds helps to increase HDL (high-density lipoproteins) and reduce LDL (low-density lipoproteins). LDL cholesterol, and central adiposity, which are all important risk factors for cardiometabolic dysfunction. They maintained HDL cholesterol concentrations, a balance that is vital to healthy cholesterol levels. Almonds are a rich source of many nutrients which help in the development and health of the human brain. They have long been considered an essential food item for growing children.These dry fruits contain two vital nutrients, riboflavin, and L-carnitine, which have been linked to increased brain activity, resulting in new neural pathways. Just like any other food, these nuts have their downside, too. They contain oxalates; excessive oxalates can cause crystallisation, which can lead to a host of different issues. Just 4 or 5 almonds have enough fibre to keep your digestion and bowel movement regular  Almonds are good in moderation\n",

       "\"So you have all these methods of tracking intensity...how hard do you want to work? \\nIt's a good idea to work at a variety of intensities: Low Intensity: This is about a Level 3-5 on the Perceived Exertion Scale. You might work at this intensity when you're warming up or if you're doing a longer workout, like a long bike ride, walk or run. This might also be an intensity you work at if you take walks throughout the day. Try this intensity about once a week.  Moderate Intensity: This is about a Level 5-6 on the Perceived Exertion Scale and where most of your workouts will fall. Think of getting on a cardio machine or going for a run and being at that place where you can talk, but only a few words. Try this level about 2-3 times a week.  High Intensity: This is about a Level 8-9 on the Perceived Exertion Scale and a level you can only work at for short periods of time. You might work at this intensity when doing high-intensity interval training. Shoot for one, maybe two times a week with lots of rest in between..\""

       "\"So you have all these methods of tracking intensity...how hard do you want to work? \\nIt's a good idea to work at a variety of intensities: Low Intensity: This is about a Level 3-5 on the Perceived Exertion Scale. You might work at this intensity when you're warming up or if you're doing a longer workout, like a long bike ride, walk or run. This might also be an intensity you work at if you take walks throughout the day. Try this intensity about once a week.  Moderate Intensity: This is about a Level 5-6 on the Perceived Exertion Scale and where most of your workouts will fall. Think of getting on a cardio machine or going for a run and being at that place where you can talk, but only a few words. Try this level about 2-3 times a week.  High Intensity: This is about a Level 8-9 on the Perceived Exertion Scale and a level you can only work at for short periods of time. You might work at this intensity when doing high-intensity interval training. Shoot for one, maybe two times a week with lots of rest in between..\""

       "\"If your mood swings last for more than two weeks and don't seem to be getting any better, tell your practitioner and reach to a professional counsellor. Some of the best counsellors are listed in our Experts sections.  If you notice that you're frequently nervous or anxious, you may be suffering from some sort of anxiety disorder. Finally, if your mood swings become more frequent and intense, you may have a condition called bipolar disorder, in which you may swing from periods of depression to mania.Accurate information about depression during pregnancy or following the birth of your baby that lets you know that you are not alone and that help is available. The life of every mother is different. No two mothers would have the same changes, the same family structure, the same family support and so on. So the challenges of each mother is different and hence is it important to have a solution that works for you. Professional support is important as it ensures that you are understood well and your solution is for your condition.  One of the most adopted therapy to manage and correct moodiness and depression across the world is CBT Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a specific type of psychological therapy.  \\nCognitive-behavior therapy combines two effective types of therapy – behavior therapy and cognitive therapy.  Behaviour therapy focus on on getting you active in your life again. The aim is to decrease behaviours that make the symptoms worse (e.g. staying in bed when you are not sleeping or avoiding social interactions) and increase behaviours that reduce the symptoms (e.g. getting dressed, getting exercise, staying connected with important people in your life) Cognitive therapy helps to: identify patterns of thinking (cognition) or self-talk which upset you or lead to negative behaviours and   learn ways to challenge these thoughts when they arise and replace them with more accurate and fair thoughts. The real strength of Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy is that it focuses on building skills to help people to take an active role in reducing their depression symptoms. This can help to prevent future episodes of depression.  Learning and using Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy (CBT) effectively requires some time, effort and motivation. In order to get benefits from this powerful treatment, people need to practice their new skills regularly. It can take some time before the benefits of CBT can be seen. Women with more severe depression may feel easily tired or unmotivated. In those situations, women may need the assistance of a mental health professional with specialized CBT training.  \""

       "'Clueing your partner in about how you\\'re feeling and reassuring him that you still love him will help him avoid taking your outbursts personally. Make sure you\\'re spending plenty of time together and nurturing your relationship. Go on a vacation if you can. Strengthen your connection now so you can really be there for one another after the baby comes. Air your worries about the future with understanding friends. Just putting your concerns into words often helps dissipate them or gives you insight into solutions. Keep the lines of communication between you and your partner free and clear, too. Make it a two-way street. In addition to pouring out your feelings, let him express his own.  Rather than let frustration build up in your life, find ways to decompress. Identify sources of stress in your life and change what you can, such as trimming your \"to-do\" list. If you still find anxiety creeping in, try taking a pregnancy yoga class, practicing meditation or other relaxation techniques, or consulting a professional counselor.  Some easy ways to cope with depression is to avoid pitfalls and think positive. It is a slow and gradual process, but some of the rules to avoid being negative are to avoid thinking traps In this thinking trap, you focus on the negative parts of a situation, and ignore the positive parts of a situation. You may only pay attention to the things that go wrong, or that you didn’t get done, and don’t give yourself credit for your accomplishments.  In this kind of thinking trap, you make up a “rule” about how things are or will be based upon one experience or event.  Hint: When people are overgeneralising, they often use words like always, never, all, every, none, nobody, and everybody. For example, “The baby never falls asleep for my partner”.  Seeing things or people as either right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. Everything is black or white, there are no shades of grey. People who think in all or nothing terms see a small mistake as a total failure.  Telling yourself that a minor negative event is/would be a complete disaster. Often people who are catastrophizing also fear that they would be unable to cope with the situation that they are imagining.  Telling yourself how you “should” or “must” act or feel.  Saying something very negative (and often unfair) about yourself or other people.  You think you know what others are thinking, without any evidence.  Making predictions about what is going to happen, with little or no evidence. People who are depressed predict that a lot of negative things are going to happen, even when the evidence suggests that this is not very likely at all.  Thinking that things (or people) are only right or worthwhile if they are perfect.  You feel overly responsible for other people’s behaviours and negative events, and do not consider other factors or people who may have influenced the situation.  Thinking that bad feelings say something about how a situation actually is. You believe that your thoughts must be true or accurate because you “feel” strongly that they are, even if there is little or no evidence to support them.  '"

       "'It’s common to get a little constipated if you don’t drink enough water. Inactivity, diet changes, illness, and even stress can add to the problem. The constipation usually passes on its own, but you can help move things along with exercise, over-the-counter meds, and of course, water. See a doctor if your constipation lasts for more than a week or two or you have dizziness, bad pain in your belly, or blood in your stool. These could be signs of something more serious. Water makes up a large part of your joint cartilage that helps absorb shock and make bone-against-bone movements smoother. Water also can help keep gout (a painful joint condition) at bay.  It helps flush toxins from your body that could inflame your joints, too. And that’s a good thing! As sweat evaporates from your skin, it cools down your body. Have a couple of extra cups of water in the couple of hours before you head out for exercise. Try to take about 10 big gulps every 15 minutes or so during your workout, too. Remember, you might not see the sweat you lose if you’re in the pool or an air-conditioned gymWithout enough water, you can sweat away too much fluid. You can also lose sodium and potassium that your body needs. It’s especially true in the heat. When it happens, you may be thirsty, pee less than usual, and your mouth might dry out. You could even feel dizzy, lightheaded, and confusedWater helps your kidneys remove waste from your blood. If you don’t get enough water, that waste -- along with acids -- can build up. That can lead to your kidneys getting clogged up with proteins called myoglobin. Dehydration can also lead to kidney stones and urinary tract infections. You may not remember as well, think as clearly, or concentrate as easily when you’re low on water. And you don’t have to be seriously dehydrated. It can happen if you’re just a little below where you should be. How little? Less than 4 cups of water in a 150-pound person. Even mild dehydration can make you tired.  So it makes sense that athletes who replace the sweat they lose with water and electrolytes (minerals like sodium and potassium) have lower body temperature, more muscle, stronger hearts, more brain power, and more energy. It all adds up to better performance. It’s common to get a little constipated if you don’t drink enough water. Inactivity, diet changes, illness, and even stress can add to the problem.

So it makes sense that athletes who replace the sweat they lose with water and electrolytes (minerals like sodium and potassium) have lower body temperature, more muscle, stronger hearts, more brain power, and more energy. It all adds up to better performance. People who had just 2 or 3 more cups of water a day seem to have less fat, sugar, salt, and overall calories through the day. That means proper hydration could help you lose weight. Extra water can replace empty, sugary calories many people drink with meals. Water also seems to speed up your metabolism, and it takes up space in your stomach so you feel more full. Your ticker doesn’t have to work as hard when you drink enough water. In fact, even mild dehydration affects your blood vessels (making them less springy) about the same as smoking a cigarette. Skimping on water also leads to less blood in your body, which can lower your blood pressure and raise your heart rate. It takes just 15 to 20 minutes for enough water to even things out. You’re less likely to pass out when you give blood if you’ve had enough water. The same seems to be true if you’re careful to replace water lost through sweat or urine. When levels get a bit low, your blood pressure can drop and your nervous system can’t control it as well. That could make you faint. Watch out for this if it’s hot outside, and especially when you exercise. A good rule of thumb is 15 cups a day for men and 11 cups for women. But keep in mind that includes total fluids. You get 20% to 30% of your water from food. You get more from other drinks like juice, tea, and milk. If you’re sick, you’ll need more (especially with diarrhea or vomiting). If you’re exercising or outside in the heat, focus on getting a little extra, too. Too much water can dilute the salt in your blood enough to make you sick (it’s called hyponatremia). Plus, you don’t want to overdo it if you have certain health issues or take drugs that cause you to retain water, like NSAIDs, opiates, antidepressants, or others. Drink enough to keep a hint of yellow in the color of your urine, but not so much that it’s always clear, or you spend all day in the bathroom. Talk to your doctor if you’re unsure. '"

       "'Pregnant women who exercise should monitor signs of potential problems, keeping in mind that if there\\'s something wrong with the pregnancy, it\\'s not caused by exercise. Rather, exercise might provide that extra bit of stress that brings the problem to the forefront. Stop exercising and consult your doctor if you have: Vaginal bleeding  Abdominal cramping  Light-headedness  Excessive nausea  Extreme headaches Also watch out for dehydration, which can cause preterm uterine contractions, and in the worst-case scenario, lead to preterm labor. Eight or nine cups of water a day is recommended during pregnancy, on average, but fluid needs should be adjusted for intensity and duration of the workout. If you experience any of these symptoms, don’t try to push through it, since doing so can leave you more susceptible to injuries: Excessive fatigue. While a good workout might leave you feeling a bit tired but accomplished, it shouldn’t exhaust you so much that walking to your car in the gym parking lot seems almost impossible.  Irritability. Those endorphins should boost your mood — so if you’re feeling more short-tempered than usual after every workout, it might be a sign that it’s time to taper back.  Joint or muscle pain. Next-day muscle soreness is one thing: It’s a faint achiness in the muscles you’ve been working on that can usually be lessened by stretching or massage. Look out for acute pain in the joints and muscles that pop up every time you work out, which is usually a sign it\\'s time to take it slower.  Trouble sleeping. Some sleep problems are totally normal during pregnancy, and exercise should help tire your body out just enough to doze off soundly once you hit the pillow. Excessive exercise, on the other hand, can have the opposite effect. If you drastically increase the duration of intense exercise, you might find it’s harder to fall — and stay — asleep. Prenatal exercise offers loads of health benefits. But before you lace up your sneakers and hit the track, make a pit stop at your practitioner\\'s office to get the green light on workouts. You\\'ll almost certainly get it — most practitioners not only permit but encourage expectant moms to stick to their usual workouts for as long as is practical. The official advice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) reads like a personal trainer\\'s pep talk: Aim for 20 to 30 minutes of some sort of physical activity every day of the week, right up until delivery. If that sounds daunting, keep in mind that activities like housework count. Even five mini-workouts sprinkled throughout the day are just as beneficial as 30 minutes straight on the elliptical. There are plenty of exercises that are great for pregnant women. In fact, most physical activity is perfectly safe during pregnancy. However there are a few exercises you’ll want to avoid: Sports that carry a higher risk of falling or abdominal injury, like gymnastics, downhill skiing, snowboarding, ice-skating, vigorous racket sports (play doubles instead of singles), horseback riding, outdoor cycling, contact sports (such as ice hockey, soccer or basketball), diving, bungee jumping and rollerblading.  Sports that involve altitude change. Unless you\\'re living in high altitudes already, avoid any activity that takes you up more than 6,000 feet. On the flip side, scuba diving, which poses a risk of decompression sickness for your baby, is also off-limits, so wait until you\\'re no longer pregnant for your next dive.  Exercises that involve lying flat on your back for long periods of time are off-limits after the fourth month, since the weight of your enlarging uterus could compress major blood vessels and restrict circulation to you and your baby. That, in turn, could make you feel nauseous, dizzy and short of breath.  Advanced abdominal moves, like full sit-ups or double leg lifts, can pull on the abdomen, so they\\'re best avoided when you\\'re expecting. Try these pregnancy-safe ab exercises instead.  Hot yoga or exercise in super hot weather: Any exercise or environment that raises your body temperature more than 1.5 degrees F should be avoided, since it causes blood to be shunted away from your uterus and to your skin as your body attempts to cool off. That means staying out of saunas, steam rooms and hot tubs, too.  Back bends or other contortions, as well as movements that involve deep flexion or extension of joints (like deep knee bends), can increase your risk of injury.  Jumping, bouncing and sudden, jerky motions are best avoided (although otherwise aerobic activity is perfectly safe so as long as you’re comfortable and can easily keep your balance).  Excessive or bouncy stretching. Since your ligaments are already looser, pregnancy isn’t the time to force a split or progress your yoga practice. If something hurts, stop.  Holding your breath is never recommended during pregnancy. Both you and your baby need a constant flow of oxygen.  Motionless standing after the first trimester can restrict blood flow, so avoid these types of movements in yoga (like tree, or extended hand to big toe) and tai chi. Your body will signal when it\\'s time to stop by saying, \"Hey, I\\'m tired.\" Take the hint right away and throw in the towel. \\nWhen to Call the Doctor \\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, stop exercising right away and give your practitioner a call: Unusual pain anywhere (hips, back, pelvis, chest, head and so on)  A cramp or stitch that doesn\\'t go away when you stop exercising  Regular, painful uterine contractions  Chest pain  Calf pain or swelling  Lightheadedness or dizziness  Very rapid heartbeat  Severe breathlessness  Difficulty walking  Loss of muscle control  Sudden headache  Increased swelling  Amniotic fluid leakage  Vaginal bleeding  A noticeable decrease or absence of fetal movement after week 28 (if things seem a bit slower, a post-workout snack should perk things up — if it doesn’t, get in touch with your doctor'"
